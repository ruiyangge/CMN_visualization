# Cortical Morphological Networks
A visualization page to show the cortical morphological networks (CMNs), which were constructed with source-based morphometry using the T1-weighted MRI data from the Human Connectome Project [HCP](http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/). One volume-based (cortical volume) and four surface-based metrics (cortical thickness, gyrification index, sulcal depth, and fractal dimension) were used to quatify the structural covariance between different brain regions among the population. 

A manuscript is under consideration: R. Ge, X. Liu, D. Long, S. Frangou, and F. Vila-Rodriguez, Sex Effects on Cortical Morphological Networks on Healthy Young Adults.
